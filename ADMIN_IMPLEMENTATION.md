# Admin Functionality Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented admin functionality for your PersonalityVN application with role-based access control. Here's what has been added:

## New Features

### 1. Role-Based Authentication
- **Three user roles**: ADMIN, PARENT, STUDENT
- **Automatic role-based redirection**: Admins are automatically redirected to the admin dashboard
- **Role-based navigation**: Different menu items for different user roles

### 2. Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- **User Management**: View, create, edit, and delete users
- **Test Management**: View all personality tests (create functionality ready for expansion)
- **Protected Access**: Only users with ADMIN role can access

### 3. Frontend Components Added
- `AdminDashboard.js` - Main admin interface with tabs for user and test management
- `AdminDashboard.css` - Styling for admin interface
- `ProtectedRoute.js` - Component to protect routes based on authentication and role
- `AdminUserService.js` - Service for admin-specific API calls

### 4. Backend Enhancements
- **New endpoints** for admin operations:
  - `PUT /api/user/{userId}` - Update user details
  - `DELETE /api/user/{userId}` - Soft delete user
  - `POST /api/user/admin/create` - Create user by admin
  - `GET /api/user/stats` - Get user statistics
- **Role-based authorization** using Spring Security
- **Proper authorities** implementation in User model

## Usage Instructions

### Default Admin Account
- **Email**: `admin@personalityvn.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: ADMIN

### Admin Features
1. **User Management**:
   - View all users in a table format
   - Create new users with any role
   - Edit existing user details
   - Delete users (soft delete)
   - Filter by role (ADMIN, PARENT, STUDENT)

2. **Automatic Role-Based Behavior**:
   - When admin logs in, they're automatically redirected to `/admin`
   - Admin navbar shows "Admin Dashboard" instead of "Personality Tests"
   - Admin badge displayed in navbar
   - Non-admin users cannot access admin routes

### Testing the Admin Functionality

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   npm start
   
   # Backend (if not running)
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Login as admin**:
   - Go to `/login`
   - Use email: `admin@personalityvn.com` and password: `admin123`
   - You'll be automatically redirected to the admin dashboard

3. **Test admin features**:
   - View all users in the User Management tab
   - Create a new user with different roles
   - Edit existing users
   - View tests in the Test Management tab

### Security Implementation
- **Frontend**: Routes protected with `ProtectedRoute` component
- **Backend**: Endpoints protected with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`
- **JWT tokens**: Include role information for authorization
- **Automatic logout**: If unauthorized access attempted

## Next Steps
1. **Database Setup**: Ensure MySQL is running and create the database
2. **Test the admin user**: Login with the default admin credentials
3. **Expand admin features**: Add more management capabilities as needed
4. **Production Security**: Change default admin password in production

The implementation provides a solid foundation for role-based access control and admin functionality. The system automatically handles user roles and provides appropriate access levels for each user type.
